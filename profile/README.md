# Welcome!

Hello! This is the organization to formally organize products and standards
I produce. This is indended to stand adjacently to my personal github account
which I treat like scratch-paper. (You get lots of cool ideas and concepts,
you try them out, and then you might not come back to them later.)

By separating these two, I am able to better organize code that is in a
prototypical/proof-of-concept state VS a project that is more mature and organized.
